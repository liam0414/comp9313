The course itself is probably one of the easiest courses I have done at UNSW. But the teaching team is really bad. Question 3 in the final was ambiguous and they didn't even bother to make an announcement during the exam, a lot of people misunderstood the question and got marks deducted. Could have scored 100 if they made an announcement

- Practical Applications: 3/5. The second half of the course is too shallow, only doing theories without any real application
- Engaging Lectures: 1/5, This course is basically a rip-off from stamford course. watch youtube instead of listening to the lecture recordings.
- Helpful Resources: 3/5, some of the labs are really good
- Supportive Community: 2/5, forum is unattended sometimes, very slow response.
- Overall rating: 3/5, give 3 stars for wam booster course
